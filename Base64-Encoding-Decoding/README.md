# Base64 Decoding and Encording Example

Create files that should take a sequence of Base64 encoded bytes as input and provide the decoded sequence as output. 
The Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding specification is available in the Support Files section (“Base64 Specification”).
If the input is empty, the output will be empty as well. The input sequence will always be valid, so no error checking is required. 
Proper handling of the final = characters is required.
